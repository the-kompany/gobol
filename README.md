The proposed Gobol language is designed as a high level language optimized for the movement and manipulation of data

OBJECTIVE:
To create a high level, highly readable and easy to work with language that is oriented around the movement and manipulation of data. That includes data in as many databases and database types as possible (SQL, NOSQL, etc), JSON, CSV, FLAT/FIXED, Excel, etc. The language will be transpiled into Golang to generate a portable executable. We want analysts to be able to maintain this language, not just programmers. The targets are for companies that have to do interchange of data with trading partners on a regular basis (ETL) as well as working with data to prepare it for analytics/BI or get conventional data into a data warehouse. GOBOL is not intended to be a general purpose language, it is highly oriented towards the stated goals of movement and manipulation of data and is intentionally not designed as a C derivative.

GOBOL is inspired by verbs and features found in [COBOL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBOL), [Go](https://golang.org/), [Python](https://www.python.org/) and the deprecated Warehouse language from [Taurus Software](https://taurus.com/) specifically.

We are looking for code contributors on the transpiler end specifically and also some corporate sponsors to bring this to fruition. If you have a bigdata or analytics company, this is something that would be useful for you.
